5.0,Kevo Dukes,"This is easily my favorite place in town. I live closer to a couple other places, but I go here probably 2 or 3 times/week. Their large pho is $7 flat after tax, ($6 for the small). Just so you understand, I can eat a whole pizza, but can't finish their large pho.  Easily the best value in town that I've found so far since moving to Houston. They're super quick bringing out my order every time, and between coming here or getting constant 50% off papa johns promos, I can't find a better way to spend $7.  I love this place enough to actually go online to rate it. So if you haven't been here, I'd highly recommend it.",['Restaurant'],110955030191040322864,1376941589,"Aug 19, 2013",100009477920726785311

1.0,Franco Marraf,"Bought vouchers on Groupon for $30 'value of $60'. So the Rip Off starts here.  You order off a separate menu for a 3 course meal which you would normally pay $30 for - but apparently its value is $60.....?   So you get over the blatant rip-off so hopefully the food/service/ambiance makes up right....  Not so.  The food is below average at best - service a little stoned and the ambiance was loud dark and confused.  This restaurant has so many issues, obviously suffering (hence the vouchers) they then serve crap over valued food to potential new customers?

1.0,Mijael Martinez,"To be fair: Great food, and generally good staff working there, at a reasonable price... It was ITS OWNER who earned it only 1 star: met him by chance while taking a friend to the restaurant; we started some small talk, and then he completely, absolutely, ignored me, concentrating on my friend (heck, he even gave his personal business card ONLY to my friend).  In my book, if you are a services supplier, the least you can do is to be thankful for your patrons, specially those who recommend your place and bring you new customers.

4.0,Chris Springer,"Parking is awful. There are not enough spots for the normal occupancy. There's the option to valet for $3, or get your car washed for $12 which is very convenient.   There green sauce is only good before Wednesday after that it tastes rather bland, I'm not sure if they make the salsa at the beginning of the week or what but that's something I've noticed. The steak fajitas are excellent. I believe they use a higher grade cut of steak, which is probably why the fajitas are a little pricey (there's also the option to upgrade to tenderloin). The re-fried black beans are great along with their green rice.

3.0,Kimberly Guel,"Me and two girlfriends ate here yesterday evening by accident. We planned to go to Raku, but I guess it's closed...? Oops. But anyways, It was around 6:00 pm so there wasn't a crowd. The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is modern and vibrant. The server was friendly and fairly knowledgeable. We had the Firenze Pizza (mushroom and sausage), the Brooklyn Pizza (chicken, broccoli, Gorgonzola) and the Carpaccio. The pizza wasn't the best I've had but I guess it wasn't the worst. I couldn't really taste the Gorgonzola and that's a pungent cheese. It tasted a little overdone on the bottom although it was flimsy. We each ordered the mango Bellini-those were yummy! In conclusion, I probably wouldn't get pizza again because I don't think it's worth the $14. Maybe I'll come back for a drink and happy hour one day though.","['European Restaurant', 'Italian Restaurant', 'Pizza Restaurant']",100060334350346730154,1370017901,"May 31, 2013",100077206753915182395

1.0,Blake Butler,"Unfortunately, over the past few months the prices have increased, service is slower, and quality has decreased. The prices have gone from affordable to very high in my opinion. All meats are now $14.95 per pound. I have never worked in the food service industry, but I dont understand how beef brisket, spare ribs, baby back ribs, pulled pork, turkey, and sausage all cost the same. I went there today and ordered a half pound of baby backs and a quarter pound of brisket. The cashier entered my ticket incorrectly for a 1/2 lb babys & 1/4 lb babys. I noticed this when I checked my togo container and asked about the brisket. Honest mistake, and I asked her to double check to make sure I receieved 3/4 lb of ribs. (Cost was $12 and there were only three ribs plus the heel.) My request wasnot received well and the tall cook with glasses in the kitchen was very upset. They asked me to step up to the counter to look in the kitchen at the scale to confirm, implying I had accused them or wrongdiong. I really couldn't tell anyways because he weighed it in the container with sauce, onions, pickles, and jalpenos. He was bobbing his head and staring me down like he wanted to fight. This seemed like a lot of drama over asking someone to double check my order. I did not request to look at the scale and, if they brought it back without anymore ribs I would have trusted them. Babys are inconsistent with the amount of meat on them, so I just wanted to make sure the kitchen did not make a mistake like the cashier. When I got back to work i was disappointed with the babys. The meat did not fall off the bone like it used to, and there was a lot more fat on them. All of the things that kept drawing me back have vanished and I will not be returning ever again. It seems they are unable to keep up the same quality with volume increase from their popularity. It is a sad drop off from the first time i went to this place and I expect to see more posts like mine in the future. I am not a BBQ fanatic and for the same price, I will be spending my money at Luling on Richmond instead.","['Barbecue Restaurant', 'Caterer', 'American Restaurant']",110106737007796553010,1336154678,"May 4, 2012",100087869357383711639

1.0,Katie Ertel,"I stopped by Pho Miss Saigon today with my children on the way home from work. It took several minutes for anyone to come to our table. I asked the waitress to give us more time but she spoke no English and couldn't understand.   I decided just to try to communicate through pantomime and she kept pointing to items on the menu that were not like what I was trying to explain.  She finally called over a new waiter who spoke English and he tried translating for us.   I wanted a grilled pork sandwich but after searching the menu and trying to translate with the waiter, I decided they probably didn't serve that item and I was getting frustrated so I decided to leave. Both waiters gave me ugly looks and insisted that I stay. I stayed out of guilt even though they hadn't even brought me water to drink yet and let the guy bring me a plate even though I told him several times it was not what I wanted.   I eventually decided just to try whatever they brought out. He brought me grilled beef on a plate of salad and tomatoes (which I don't like and can't eat)  with sautéed purple onions and garlic and with a side of bread. No carrots, no cilantro, no cucumber, no garlic butter, no grilled pork. NOT a bahn mi.  I tried to eat some of it but it wasn't what I wanted so I stopped eating. The waiter came by and asked me if I liked it and since I had tried several times to explain AND tried to leave, I decided he should know how I felt about it.   I even googled a picture of a bahn mi to show to him and he insisted that what he served me WAS a bahn mi, I just had to make it myself, and that I had no idea what I was talking about.  Since the service was so incredibly slow, and I've been here before and always paid at the bar, I started gathering our things. The waiter at that point ran up to me frantically, saying i had to pay the bill. I'm not sure how they thought I could skimp out on the bill when I was carrying a purse, brief case, left overs, drinks, and had two kids under age 8 in tow.   I speak multiple languages and have never had a problem like this before- especially since I eat Vietnamese food on a regular basis and know the names of several of my favorite dishes. I was very offended at how I was treated here and got the feeling that perhaps they just didn't have time or patience for ""my kind""- a distinct impression and a way I've never felt before.

1.0,Katie Ertel,"DO NOT GO HERE!  SCROLL DOWN FOR HORRID MANAGEMENT EXPerIENCE! I have been to this restaurant three times and the food was bad each time. I returned two more times because it's such a beautiful restaurant and great location, I was hoping it would improve. Here was our experience: -Calamari: average. -Ceasar and house italian dressing- wonderful. Seriously amazing. -Bellini- tasted like a watered down peach margarita and was super small. Overpriced at $4. -Egglant parm- GROSS! Never seen my husband turn away food before. I tried it also and spit it out. Soggy, bland, NOT ITALIAN! DO NOT ORDER! -Veal, substitute alfredo for marinara- the waitress told us that the marinara sauce was out of a can. The veal tasted like a Jenny Craig frozen meal with extra salt. The alfredo was bland, no taste at all. TGIF has way better alfredo sauce...and I DO NOT like chain restaurants.   Now, the waitress was perfectly nice, although not very professional. She didn't return to our table for a very long time and when she did, she told us that someone was caught stealing CO2 cans and the owner/manager was giving the staff a lecture.  After she charged us full price for food we BARELY touched,  we asked nicely to speak to the manager. The server warned us that the manager ""might be rude."" AND BOY WAS HE!  The first thing he asked us was ""what we suggested he do about it."" We asked that he comp a meal and he responded, ""That's just not the way to do it."" My husband, who has 12 years of experience in food service, was able to remain calm. I had to walk out after he asked me why I kept returning to his restaurant. After about 15 minutes, I walked back to the front door where the waitress apologized profusely and said she only worked there because she was desperate for a job. We ended up paying for the salad, bread, alfredo and drinks.  Food is probably microwaved, but DISGUSTING customer service from the management. Just imagine how horribly this man treats his employees!","['Italian Restaurant', 'Bar']",111207933938723854845,1374370865,"Jul 20, 2013",100141301186206476889

4.0,Colin Sullender,"I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner. There was a small group of people waiting and we were told 15 minutes. Walking to the bathroom, I noticed that only half the tables were in use. There were more tables available than twice the number of parties waiting. We ended up waiting nearly 40 minutes before being given a table. The same table that we had been standing next to the entire time.   Everything proceeds smoothly from here until the delivery of food where my order was lost/forgotten. Once the waiter realizes that we're trying to get his attention and that my food is missing, he runs off to find it. After another 5-10 minutes, I finally get my Stuffed Poblano Chicken.   I usually don't complain about food unless it warrants it. This chile relleno was one of the blandest things I have ever eaten. The chicken was tasteless and dry. The ""jack cheese"" was just a white mass that competed with the chicken for blandness. The only way to save this travesty was gratuitous application of the house salsa (actually good).   And now for the kicker: One of my fellow diners went to the women's bathroom and returned with a horrifying tale. There was standing water covering the bathroom floor that appeared to be coming from one of the toilets. Upon mentioning it to an employee, she was told that it was ""just a leak and that they cannot get it fixed during the weekend."" What? That's stupid. There are 24/7 plumbers for EXACTLY THIS SCENARIO. You are running a food establishment. You shouldn't have any water, more or less toilet water, covering the floor of the bathroom. And you absolutely shouldn't tell your guests that it's not a priority to fix it.

4.0,Jimmy Ho,"Some of you may know I did not eat barbecue till I started college. I grew up in the Houston area, but I had no sense of the barbecue scene there. The only BBQ joint I have eaten in H-Town was at Goode Company Barbeque. An ex-girlfriend introduced me to it, and I liked the food so much, I wanted to eat there every time I go home. It had all changed the last time I ate there though. I had just finished my first marathon, and my wife and I went there to ""celebrate."" The brisket was dry and not good. They also did not have any moist but only lean? Weird. Everything I ate was forgettable and borderline bad. We were going to Houston this time for the Justin Timberlake concert. I know. You can blame the wife on this one. This at least gave me an opportunity to try some new places. I consulted the Texas Monthly Top 50 list for some help and ended up choosing Gatlin's BBQ because it was not out of our way to the hotel.  Trying to park around Gatlin's was a pain. It was in an industrial part of town, and they were busy as well. A good sign, right? The eating space inside was a little bit cramp. They did have outside seating, but we were not tempted to do so on this cold day. Did you know that the pitmaster/owner Greg Gatlin used to be a defensive back at Rice? [insert Miley Cyrus voice] ""That's pretty cool."" Today I ordered the usual- brisket, ribs, and sausage. Surprise, surprise. The brisket was solid. It had a good crust with a nice smoke ring. It was a tad dry and could have used a little bit more salt, but I still liked it. The ribs were the winner here. They were tender and juicy and had an excellent rub/glaze. The smoke was also on point as well. I could probably have eaten a rack of them. The homemade spicy sausage definitely had a kick. I like the grit and casing, and it had an ideal flavor. I also got some potato salad and coleslaw on the side. The potato salad, although mustard based, was really good. It was eggy and sweet. The coleslaw was not bad either. I should have tried the dirty rice. I heard it was delicious and awesome. Maybe next time?  Gatlin's BBQ is a definitely a great choice for barbecue in the Houston area. I enjoyed everything I ate, but I wanted something more. For once, the hype got to me but do not get me wrong. It is worth the visit no matter where you live in Houston or beyond. I also met Greg's mom, Mary. She has to be the nicest person in the barbecue business. Next time I go to Houston, Gatlin's will be definitely on my radar again.","['Barbecue Restaurant', 'Caterer', 'American Restaurant']",110106737007796553010,1389667073,"Jan 13, 2014",100396798302758010113

The good, is that the rest of ingredients were fresh and tasted very good, the place was clean and the price for a 6"" sub is $3.99, pretty cheap.

You get to see the kitchen working their magic. I am a huge foodie and have brought a diverse group of people here again and again. The service is WONDERFUL! Very attentive, clean and knowledgeable.There is nothing worse than a waiter that can't explain the menu thoroughly. This place trains their waiters very well. Granted, treat them well and you will receive great service. The dishes are creative twists to classics. The portions are moderate. The prices are on the higher range of dinning. You must take into account the location, which is prime real estate in Houston, the quality of food and service. Overall, a really great go to spot. Wonderful Friday and Saturday dinner or drink spot. At the end of dinner, each time I've gone, we received an extra to-go treat. Each time has been different as well. We've had a cinnamon-nutty muffin and a macadamian nut cookie bar. This contributes to the 4.5 stars. Going home with treats is a super plus!! Please continue to do so. It really sets you apart from other restaurants. The money is in the details!! The only thing stopping them from getting 5 stars is elevating the food a tad bit more. Consistency is key is this type of industry so I hope they read their reviews and keep up the good work.   As for those that said it was too loud or too expensive.

The private dining room was a bit cramped, I often felt like I was in the way of the other guests and the servers. that is really the only downside. We were served excellent Argentinian red wine and beer only moments after arriving, followed shortly by amazing appetizers: a mix of deep fried empinadas (beef, chicken, corn & spinach), served with a refreshing cilantro infused cream dip, garlic butter bathed crab fingers, fried provolone cheese topped with a generous serving of thinly sliced prosciutto, little yucca breads lathered in garlic butter, freshly fried in-house made potato chips, served in a hot ceramic bowl..followed with a mango salad, good, but not great, but then.. The streaks came..

But then came dessert, I chose the dulce de leche cheesecake..

3.0,Nafisa Mahmood,"We went to All Bengal Sweets & Snacks recently on a trip to Houston. We've heard so much about the place that our expectations were very, very high. This hole-in-the-wall establishment has been around for quite sometime now I assume. The small dining area is adjoining a smaller grocery section. Their most popular items include fish curry (ilish/hilsha) and handmade sweets. We went during lunch time, the owner (or seemed like the owner) was taking orders and cashing that day so once it was our turn, he took our order but didn't seem to want to explain anything to us, he seemed rushed and grumpy. Funny thing is most of the restaurant was empty. While the food is great and tastes authentically Bangladeshi, the portions are meager, as they give you a lootttt of sauce with few pieces of chicken or fish in it. We also took a box of rasmalai on our way out only to find out that it was spoiled. So much for the hype! I think their food is good but if you know how to make bangladeshi food, you can whip up stuff like this at home.

As one of our friends said, ""It's what you would expect for Mexican food at 3 a.m.""  I would have certainly been very disappointed had I read some of the rave reviews on here before going, but, again, it was perfectly fine for 3 a.m.  We got the steak fajita enchiladas and chile relleno.  The texture of the chile relleno was a little off.  The fajita meat was a little dry. The salsa verde just tasted like blended jalepenos -- it was spicy but somewhat flavorless.  The salsa roja was fine.  The tortillas, which were dried out and crunchy in places, were by far the worst part of the meal.  The service was very quick and the prices reasonable.    Would I go there again if I were hungry in this neighborhood late at night?  Yes.  Would I go there at any other time of day?  No.  Would I come in from a different neighborhood to eat here?

I may return and re-review this place afterwards.  I came here to meet up with some friends for a nightcap.  With one exception, the tap list consisted of Texas craft brews.  The one exception was Petrus Aged Pale from Brouwerij Bavik, which was quite a surprise to have on tap.  While waiting for friends to arrive, I started to look up the reviews of the beers on their tap list on Rate Beer and was shocked by how poorly most of them were reviewed.  We all ended up ordering the only IPA on the list, which happened to be the only well-reviewed beer (except for the Petrus), but they were out of that one. They had another IPA which was not as good.  Although the host seemed a bit confused and mumbled a lot, the server was very friendly and outgoing.

As a lifelong barbecue cook and expert who has competed in thousands of competitions and fed tens of thousands of people I know cook times on barbecue.  The chicken should have been done first.  At any rate I settled for baby back pork ribs, and sliced beef brisket.  Then they told me to come by at 12:30 to pick up my order!  Folks that is 50 minutes to prepare a pound of ribs and a pound of sliced beef brisket--I can do that work in less than 1 minute with one hand tied.  So I show up at 12:30 and WAIT another 30 minutes for these slow moving folks to prepare my food.  No sense of urgency.  When I get back to my office with brisket that was obviously not freshly cooked, it is crusty and dry and just barely warm, the ribs are better but over cooked and exposed to too much smoke--likely pecan wood. The Dirty Rice is good, the green beans are canned but passable because they are properly seasoned and bacon is present.  The whole meal was $46.87--for bad barbecue!--Ouch!

Don't get me wrong, those places are pretty good, but sometimes all you really want is a brunch that's not going to break the bank and a waiter/waitress who is not going to bother you every five minutes and coax you into leaving. Thank goodness for Buffalo Grille where a good meal usually costs me $8 or less and you can stay there hours on end without being bothered.   I first discovered Buffalo Grille on New Year's Day and it was the best hangover cure ever. DON'T JUDGE ME, I know this is a family friendly place, but sometimes you need some good breakfast food to cure a bad hangover. Our group got tons to order, but among my favorites were the hash browns (so golden and crispy!), strawberry french toast, omelette, and my absolute favorite was the stuffed baked potato (#4) that has cheese, avocado, salsa, and so much goodness in it. Seriously, I still crave it. I've been back a couple of times and once a friend got their cream cheese and chive eggs which were also delicious.

Why would you add apple cider vinegar as well as sherry vinegar?  There was some other flavors I could not identify.  The potatoes themselves had no flavor.  Red potatoes are waxy and do not absorb flavor. I ordered a BLT that would have been good but the bacon was thick and hard...very difficult to chew.  If you are going serve thick bacon, it must be crisp.  Otherwise it is just hard.",['Restaurant'],112295229582288987484,1391536401,"Feb 4, 2014",100881745087917623865

2.0,Lyndsey Stang,"This place centers around children.  If you don't want noise, head somewhere else.  It has a large area where kids can roam around and play in a small sandbox.  It probably needs to be larger to fit the many kids that show up here.  There are animals for the kids to feed and they get the food from a quarter machine.  Hand sanitizers are nearby as well.  Bring a ball for your kid to kick around though.  There aren't always enough for everyone to kick around.  As for the food.  Eh...  Your plate will be full of food but don't expect an explosion of flavor.  I love chili burgers and hoped it would be great here.  My basket came to the table and I took a bite.  I was hoping I'd do a happy food dance or at least my eyes would roll to the back of my head since they have ""changed"" since a few years ago when the parking lot would hardly fill up.  Nope. I think you get more food and the flavor has slightly gotten better from a 2 to a 3 stars if that.  The burger patties don't contain any seasoning that can be detected.  The fries are large cut but aren't a big deal.  Their spinach and artichoke dip is the same as anywhere else.  I've ordered a chicken fried steak here as well.  Nothing amazing.  Nothing great either.  It was something you'd find in a diner that cooks everything in lard.    Customer service is great at least.  The manager will most likely come by and ask how you're doing and she or another waiter will come by and ask if you'd like a refill on your drink.    Don't expect amazing flavor.  If you want great burgers, or food for that matter, head to Beck's Prime for AMAZING burgers that will leave you speechless because your mouth will be full and, the prices are about the same.  I think what makes this place popular is the large playground only.  Parents can invite their friends with kids, sit on the porch and drink a beer with their food while knowing their kids are playing their hearts out.  My husband thinks all food is great and even suggests we go somewhere else to eat when I suggest Clay's when my toddler is needing food a place to play.  It's not worth the money for the whole family to go.  It's better if I just take my toddler, buy him a lunch and then I will eat somewhere else when he fall asleep in the car from playing.","['American Restaurant', 'Hamburger Restaurant']",100133034805673022316,1334594315,"Apr 16, 2012",100955387717990013645

Bosnia, being part of the former Yugoslavia, just as the homeland of my father, Macedonia, had been, how could I resist? And the place is within walking distance of where I live!   It specializes in Bosnian cuisine, tasty dishes that would be familiar to anyone with roots in the Balkans.  8 appetizers, all under $8, 7 soups and salads, all under $7.  7 entrees, all under $12, 6 sandwiches, all under $8.  4 house specials, all under $20, 5 pizzas, all under $10.  4 desserts, all under $4, and a variety of fountain drinks, bottled sodas, and drinks, and coffees, all $3 or less.  The place is located across the street from the Target and Randall's, in a small, unassuming, little shopping center. I was welcomed at the door and chose a table in a back corner, next to some framed photos of the ""old country"", and a handful of old Yugoslavian bills and coins..  My order?  Bosnian Grah, Potato Burek (Pita), Stuffed Peppers, Bosnian Goulash, all washed down with several glasses of Dr. Pepper (thank God for free refills!).  Total cost: $24.25 + $3.75 gratuity = $28.  Yes, I ate all of it, except for a portion of the Burek, which I took home to finish later.   To say that everything was absolutely delicious barely does it all justice.

I started with the duck pithiviers, which is duck in a sort of pastry. It had a deep, delicious flavor. My main course was the pork - my companions got the beef. Really, none of them were really that amazing. Each seemed too small to be hearty, and the flavors were all a bit muted. The desserts were all a bit lighter - which can be a welcome end to a great meal, though that's not what you necessarily expect from s'mores.

The service was fine, and it's $8.50 for a pretty fantastic 1/3 lb burger with your choice of toppings, and extra $2 for a single order of fries. I got their Counter Burger which was $10.50... a bit pricey, but it came with so many onion rings on it the burger was massively tall - so I took off half of them and had my burger with a side of onion rings. I found the fries well seasoned but not overly seasoned - very nice.  I recommend you go here, get a 1/3 lb burger and share a single order of fries with a buddy. This is more than enough food.

And, on that though, the two biggest downsides to the place is the atrocious parking and that it's oddly dark, especially toward the back. They have some lamps back there, but clearly not enough.  Once you actually get parked and walk in (and have your eyes adjust), you take a seat and someone takes your order. When you're done, walk up to the register to pay.  The food, is great. The banh mi comes on a french bread that has a great balance of crispy and soft - too many places use bread that's either all soft (french bread should not be soft) or is rock hard (eating french bread should not cause pain). The pho broth is wonderfully dark and beefy. This place seems to really love their Vietnamese soups.  They also have Vietnamese coffee varieties that you can't find everywhere - with or without condensed milk, served hot or cold. Similar options of tea might be nice. Or maybe if they partnered with a bakery to serve more baked goods.

5.0,Jonathan Nassar,"A memorable meal. Chris Shepherd basically delivers on his promise of Houston food with a mish-mash of flavors and inspirations. Still, I feel he could have gone further and some dishes could be a bit better.  The menu is constantly changing, but the Korean Braised Goat & Dumplings are a standard. And, trying it, I can see why. Warning - it's spicy. I usually avoid this (high) level of spice, but in this dish it surprised me how well it worked. I don't think I've ever had a dish that spicy that worked that well.  The slow cooked pork belly was good and came with grits and a guinea egg. It was very good, but I think I would have preferred the pork belly crispier - it make me wish for the pork belly at Artisans.  The French bean / pole bean / sweet bean dish was a standout dish, a salad with an interesting variety of beans and a great dressing.  The butcher's cut, for the night, was a wagyu ribeye steak. I usually avoid steaks (steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in this city), but this was pretty amazing. It came with kale chimichurri (very good, but not necessary with the great meat) and sweet potato au gratin (good, not great... would have preferred a sweet potato mash).  To end the night, we got zucchini bread - I could have eaten the whole loaf - with lemon basil cream (a bit out of place in the mix) and toasted oat ice cream (could have eaten the pint).  We'd definitely come here again. Though, in the future, I would probably consider not bothering with reservations and just grabbing a bar or patio table.  I should mention - the wine menu I thought was great, had a section on Texas wines, and had a section for half bottles (better, I think, for two than a full bottle).  The place is very cool as well. The service was good, but our waitress was a bit on the awkward side and spoke very quickly and quietly. Good service, but we've had better.

My wife got the new york strip, which was also just right. It came with a side of potatoes au gratin served in a cute tiny le creuset pot and the ragout was more a sauce made with diced tomatoes rather than pureed and were excellent. It was better than the bearnaise sauce, which I think she would have preferred on the side.  I got the crispy rosemary pork belly, which stunned me with deliciousness at every bite. The side of creamy polenta was expertly prepared, and I also got root vegetables (beets, which were good though I'm not a beet fan) and excellent brussel sprouts. There were also drops of a super thick balsamic reduction, which added a nice counterpoint to the rest of the flavors. I would have liked a bowl of that.  We ended off with their decadent chocolate rum cake, which came with not enough ice cream for the cake, but it was also very good.

I had the salmon for my main course, which was good but could have come with a bit more - rice or cous cous or something. I ended with the peanut butter praline, which was also delicious, but I don't think the name really matched what they were going for - the flavors consisted of peanut butter, banana, and chocolate. Tasty, but 'peanut butter praline' doesn't really capture all of that. Your menu is a marketing tool for your food - use it well.  It may be strange to say, but I appreciate that the business seems put together and run well very - the valet is efficient, the wait staff is great, and the kitchen is very organized. I think they run a very good operation.  Below: old review. Came here for a happy hour and sat in the bar. Everything was expertly done plus some.

Even the more-normal roasted veggies were delicious. Their specialty drinks are also very good.  The second time, I tried a chicken burger thing - also excellent, and their fries have a really good interesting spice mix on them (a little heavily caked on toward the bottom, though). For appetizer, we tried the chicken wings (a good level of kick, I though) and the goat samosas. Both were great, and you could consider the samosas for a small meal. I tried a local cider this time around - and I have to say their drink selection has a pretty good variety to it.  We ended with a couple of desserts to share for the table. The ice cream sandwiches are really great - the ice cream is a malted chocolate, which adds an interesting depth to the chocolate. They're easy to share between four people, too. The pie was more 'interesting' at first, but as you try it a bit more you really appreciate the balance of chai spices in a not-too-sweet style dessert. We the pie was gone, I appreciated how well balanced it was.  The coffee's also good here, and the service is just outstanding.

The owner tried to up-sell us on EVERYTHING, was extremely pushy and we ended up ordering for the entire table 2 of the ""BOMBAY FEASTS""  and 2 of the ""TANDOORI FEASTS"" that were each $49, yes, that's right $49.  So for $200, you expect it to feed 12 people right? WRONG! THIS GUY IS A CON ARTIST!!!!!  THE OWNER TRIED TO COMBINE PLATES TO GIVE US LESS FOOD, WE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED 4 DISHES OF EACH, INSTEAD WE RECEIVED ONE OR TWO PLATES EACH AND WERE TOLD HE ""COMBINED THEM INTO ONE PLATE""   WE RECEIVED OUR TWO ORDERS OF THE ""TANDOORI FEAST"" (REMEMBER THIS COST $49 EACH, SO IT'S A $100).   WHAT DO WE GET? ONE PLATE, YES, ONE PLATE OF TANDOORI CHICKEN WITH ABOUT 8 PIECES OF MEAT ON IT. THAT'S A $100 PLATE OF TANDOORI CHICKEN THAT ANYWHERE ELSE WOULD HAVE COST $15 AT THE MOST!!!!!!!

2.0,Kathy Smith,"I didn't want to write this but the manager, David, and the Valet worker, Juan Saragosa, did not take care of me as a long time old customer. I have been an old customer from once the establishment opened. My family and I were personal friends of God bless his soul, original owner, MIRKO. I had attended a 80's party across the street at Numbers and thought it was safe to park at Michealangelo's since they offered the public to park in their personal property and paid the valet for it. When I returned at 1:45am, I found two bottle of broken glass that were thrown at my tire. The valet attendant, Juan Saragosa, was present along with the whole kitchen staff who saw me and my girlfriend leave. As soon as I left the parking lot, my tire went flat and I had to pull over to the Valero gas station where a nice stranger changed my tire. I spoke to David on the phone and he agreed to look at the camera footage and told me to present the new tire bill to him. I dropped off the bill and talked with Juan and he was not interested in listening to me at all. He argued with me and made me feel terrible. It was clearly the restaurant's fault as I was allowed to park on their private property. David never returned my phone calls either!!!

Just a good 'ol burger. The onion rings are hand-dripped, and are yummy, but know the batter is substantial, not one of those thin batters. Fries are not bad! Price is decent, though a burger, fries/o-ring, and drink will run you over $10. They also have a few chicken sandwich options (seasoned nicely!) and salads, or grilled cheese for the kids. The place is always clean and the staff is quick and polite. Does get quite busy at lunch time though. If you don't know where to go for lunch, try Southwell's.

Their desserts generally disappoint me, but the actual meals are in big enough proportions to split it between lunch and dinner and they taste great. This is especially true if you get a salad and a side instead of two sides - it doesn't add much to the cost, but you can eat the salad and the side (the salad's only good fresh and that's usually the case for the side) and eat the main course later.

What i got was a bowl of linguine with milk and fishy seafood. No taste to it at ALL. The service was OK. Nothing more, nothing less. It took our server 10minutes to bring grated cheese (to try and add taste to my meal). The waiter never brought lemon after asking him 2 times, i gave up. I just wanted to get the HECK out of there.

The third one I tried with the tofu, the one that was darker than redder than the rest, tasted very foul. I came home feeling bloated and not very good.

4.0,Bang Bui,"I've tasted quite a few Indian restaurants in this area, but Tandoori Garden's selection and dishes were like the 3-star rating describes: A-OK. For a $9.99 buffet, I do admit that is quite a pretty cheap deal for Indian food. But there's a reason why it's priced at $9.99. Even before I tasted the dishes, even before I took a look at the food, I could tell by walking inside what the quality was going to be like. When I approached the food at the counter, the chicken tikka masala had a chunky consistency, instead of the creamy texture I would see at other Indian buffets. The saag paneer had more of a runny appearance than it did of thickness. The tandoori chicken was just chopped into pieces rather than left whole as a leg.  Overall, I found the waiters to be very friendly. The restaurant is too far from my house to come back and experience again, but that didn't affect my rating, though.  You can go to a really nice-looking restaurant and get terrible food and service. You can go to a hole-in-the-wall restaurant and receive a wonderful dining experience. It just really depends on the effort made by the proprietor.","['Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'South Asian Restaurant']",107865344984470745240,1361216677,"Feb 18, 2013",101486490108402566778

4.0,Bang Bui,"I'm impressed with the quality Bombay Pizza Co. had offered my co-workers and me when we arrived at our company meetup in August 2012. I love eating Indian food, so when I discovered that a pizza restaurant's topping specialties are particularly just that, I knew this place would be a great spot for us to enjoy.  I ordered the Saag Paneer pizza, while my co-workers had gotten the Berry Bombay and the Bombay Ranch. All the specialties were delicious. Interesting crunchy thin crust, rich cheese taste, fresh-tasting ingredients, I really want to eat again and again had it not been so expensive. For my co-worker with the Bombay Ranch, she specifically asked for the cilantro to be removed, so they had to re-do the pizza and remove the cilantro and she had to wait longer, although it wasn't a big deal since we shared pizzas with each other.  I had a great time with my co-workers there and spent 3 hours talking about work and whatnot, and we just enjoyed the atmosphere all the while.

My husband and I ventured inside the loop for the first time since we moved back to Houston a few months ago to go to a movie that was playing next door.  We should have stayed in the suburbs.  We wanted Mediterranean food and figured we had plenty of time to eat and get to the movie with time to spare as we had nearly an hour and a half.  We were almost late.  We both order the gyros.  The service was slow and inattentive.  I decided that I would like to have a domestic beer as it was happy hour all Sunday.  The waiter brought me a beverage menu and I saw that Shiner Bock was listed with the other domestic beers for $3.25 and the imports were priced at $4.50.  The happy hour price was $2.00 for domestics and $3.00 for imports.  I thought a $2.00 Shiner would be nice with my gyro.  I wish this was all about the price of the beer but my satisfaction level was already at zero rapidly moving into the negative range before the bill came.  Did I mentioned the service was slow and inattentive?  My water glass was empty for most of the meal and only refilled as we were waiting for the check and then by the hostess.  I had to ask the waiter more than once for additional sauce, unfortunately a quart of tzatziki sauce wouldn't have improved the gyro meat which was as dry and overcooked as cardboard with almost as much flavor.  The salad and fries were okay but no better than what I could purchase with bagged salad and bottled dressing.  By the time the bill arrived we were running late and the waiter informed us that Shiner is considered an ""import"" with the happy hour price being $3.00...an entire 25 cent discount off the regular price.  At this point I told him fine after he insisted that it was final from the mgmt. but there would be bad internet reviews.  He took it back to get it corrected only to wait and finally told him we had to leave now.  We paid the $3.00 price, as we were leaving the manager came out too late.  There's got to be a place in the NW burbs where I can find a decent gyro that doesn't cost me $10 for bad food.","['Mediterranean Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Middle Eastern Restaurant']",113229077765358908772,1378075102,"Sep 1, 2013",101508431784897122812

The vegetables were a little spicy with curry for my tastes but that is because I don't like spicy. The naan was the best I've ever had hands down. They make it themselves fresh everyday!!! The second time I went I got the tandoori chicken with rice and chic peas. Again the veggie was a little too spicy for me. The tandoori chicken wasn't what I expected since it wasn't served with yogurt sauce on it. And be warned!!! The green sauce they do serve it with is extra hot. I got garlic naan that time and it came out fresh out of the clay pot. Soooo good!!!  The owners have had this place since october '12 and they are always very friendly and attentive to us. Only negative I may have is that the lunch buffet does only have three types of meat everyday. But you can order from the menu if you want variety.

4.0,Jon Rosenthal,"Today we went to backstreet for a late lunch/early dinner, it was Saturday afternoon around 4:30 PM.  They offered to seat us inside, but the space inside around the bar area seemed cramped and the table they showed us was terribly small (my wife and I like to sit close, not across from each other at a skinny little table).  I asked if we could sit at a different table and they offered to seat us outside on the patio....  It was a beautiful day today and the patio was very nice.  It was comfortable and breezy, and our table was shaded by an umbrella.  The atmosphere was perfect for a lovely romantic meal.    My wife picked a wine from the impressive selection, and I tried the house Sangria.  The Sangria was just a slight bit tart for my taste, but most folks will probably like it.  My wife's wine was much to her liking.    For appetizers we shared the fried green tomato salad and the bacon-wrapped quail.  Both were lovely and nicely presented.  We enjoyed the variety of flavors that seemed to pair very well with our drinks.  The salad was lightly dressed, allowing the flavors of the arrugula, fried green tomatoes, nuts, and bleu cheese crumbles to come through.  The bacon wrapped qual had stronger flavors of smokey salted meat, and was served with some cheese grits and a corn bread biscuit (that was either called corn pudding or a biscuit, I can't remember).    My wife had the shellfish risoto and I had the crispy duck for our entrees.  Both were well presented and nicely prepared.    The duck was served on a bed of wilted spinach greens with a large dollop of spiced, whipped sweet potato and some halved (roasted or sauteed?) mission figs.  The dish was superb in my opinion, a bit on the sweet side but also savory.  The duck was beautifully cooked and had just a slight char on the skin to balance the sweetness of the yams and figs.   The shellfish risoto had a nice assortment of scallops, shrimp, clams, and mussels with a small lobster tail.  The risoto was well prepared (I dislike overly cooked pasta so I appreciated that this was properly prepared).  The shellfish overall were very good, especially the scallops, but I felt that the shrimp could have been fresher.  It was good, but could have been better.  I'd rate the dish ""very good"".    For desert I had some lovely Sauterne wine and also we shared the fresh fruit cobbler (it was rasberry).  The cobbler was excellent.  It was loaded with very fresh fruit and had a nice crispy home-made crust.  It was sweetened, but the natural rasberry tartness came though loud and clear.  It was served hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top that was perfect to balance the rasberry tartness.    The service was relaxed but efficient, and most of the staff gave attention to the small details that can really make a difference in a meal...from balancing/stabilizing the table for us to keeping our drinks filled and making helpful suggestions for menu selections.  The manager checked on us twice, which is something I appreciate.    Overall, I think it's a great palce for foodies who also enjoy a nice wine selection.  They incorporate seasonal selections in the cuisine to keep things fresh and fun.  The service was good, but this is a plce to relax and enjoy...it's not a quick bite.    They are obviously popular and it's medium sized, so reserve ahead of time.  I don't like ""2-top"" tables and do not want to feel squeezed in or crowded, so I will be careful to specify my table choice and will probably avoid eating there during peak business hours for them.    All that said, I will certainly return for another lovely meal at off-peak hours.

1.0,Parag Mehta,"Visited the restaurant in early February.  Made a reservation, arrived to find out they gave our table away even though we came within the time window we booked.  Waitress was very unfriendly, condescending, and rude.  Did not want to accomodate the vegetarians in the group.  She did not provide a dessert menu until we asked for one. She never asked us if we were ready to order drinks until we finally flagged her colleague down. I asked for straws for the water, she gave us 4 (there were 6 of us). She brought 4 plates (again there were 6 of us). At every turn she was condescending and dismissive.   One member of our party was adhering to a special diet for personal reasons. She is only able to eat cut up fruit in the evenings. She brought her fruit in a tupperwear and took it out when our meals came out. Immediately, out of nowhere the waitress zoomed in on her. ""Did you ACTUALLY bring your own food??!"" she asked incredulously. My friend was too stunned to speak.  A few moments later the manager appears. He informs us that outside food is not allowed and it's a violation of the health code. We tried to explain the reason behind the special diet but he was not interested in it.

Another trip to Sassafras so they can give money back on those items, well that isn't what they did.  They gave us some of the money and a $20 certificate?  We aren't going back so the $20 certificate is worthless.  When I called the owner - Diego he said that I had to bring the other food back to get the rest of the money so another trip and when I said that this would be a forth trip to them in one night his comment was ""that is not my problem"".  So 4th trip but Diego called the police when I came in with the food.  He and the cashier told us that they were giving us the money back and went in the back acting like they were processing the credit but they were waiting until the police arrived.  So the police arrived and they had to give the $20 in cash instead of certificate.  Amazing that these guys called the cops on their own customer then the resolution with the cops was that they had to pay for the food they told us to return.

3.0,eric trejo,"I'd give this a 3.5 cus it's better than okay for the concept, offerings and taste.  To me this is Good Quick & or late night Food! The there's good flavor and the right size portions depending on how hungry you are.  Bao's: The buns are thick and soft, but dont seem that way when you eat them. They have an interesting texture and are slightly chewy in a good way. I really Loved the Bao's for use as a holder for the food!  Food: Crab Daddy is really tasty but the only thing i did't like is the non meat part like the stuff that's grainy and green (but again that's a whole crab). it throws off the flavor but gives it a lil salty sea taste to it if you like that. But since its fried I'd eat this 1st as it won't be as good if it sits since you get a lil oily aftertaste  Memphis BBQ was really good.The flavors of the Asian slaw, beef and the glaze on it all parried nicely for the final flavor. I couldn't get enough of the slaw juice as it really tasted good on this! The texture of this one was great as the meat a lil tender but firm, to the soft and chewy bao with the slaw as medium between each giving it more filling than just the meat and bao.  Onion Rings were really good, there not the best I've had as they're a lil thin but the batter is light and crunchy and has more volume than the others I've had. So that made it up for me with the Kimchi-mayo! They have a light flavor despite the seasonings which didn't really seem to add much too it as it wast salty or hot. And the Kimchee-mayo is more mayo from what i tasted than kimchi, even if the cabbage is blended into it... my guess is so that everyone will like it  Inside: The inside is small but not too small, they do have a few small tables in the front but the rest are those high rectangular tables that kinda seem to throw it off a lil for me as not going well with the theme. as my 1st impression was a chill and laid back spot from the front and then when you look to the side it reminds you of hooters. so there's not much privacy there if you bring someone... other than that they have a few small screens and the place is kinda relaxing  Final thoughts: I do wish they had maybe some dipping sauces or juice sauces (Asian slaw) on the side, it seems like they have a good start and have a few more things to add to the menu or offer. I was surprised at the beers they offered and they even have free cumber water lol. There wasn't much spice as i had thought but the flavors are there, like i said i guess its to attract a wide rang of people just trying to venture out and not be scared away. Another good thing would be to offer a spicy version along with the regular one!  Upon eating my food i got to talking to sun and he was a informative and helpful about the menu and food. I was really interested in alot of what they offered and were about. And come to find out that kimchee-mayo has actual cabbage in it, so +1 for getting your veggies in! Lol and they make alot of there sauces and even ramen  too! They apparently just started up 11 months ago so I'm glad i ain't missed this spot like soo many others   My only thought to keep this food up to par would be to keep the oil fresh! As it does detract from the food if its not and will make it taste just like greasy fast food that wouldn't be that good.

The menu was simple and you had to know what you were getting otherwise you dont know whats in it, not even a take out menu to see either. The menu board is plain cut for the foods offered and they have a special of the day written on the center of it. It smelled clean and was slightly dark but after seeing some people get there food and smelling it, it took me back to what i knew the food was suppose to smell like if i had tasted it! The lady taking my order even spoke spanish too so huge plus if you speak any spanish.  I ended up getting a few things to try out and see if the place was any good...  Beef Seekh kebab – Is Very Deliciously Fragrant with a lil bit of heat for flavor. The meat seemed to be mixed with a kind of sausage for flavor. There’s 2 per order (1.5 dia x 8” lng) and worth the price, this goes great with the green sauce  Samosa aloo - is ok because of one of the spices didn’t make it taste right to me; I’m think it was a pepper as it wasn’t hot but kinda threw off the taste for me. The crust was crunchy and potatoes were firm and soft, moderately spice and fragrant. It was hot and hadn't sat out like other places. If they have a sweet tamarind sauce it’d be better or you could take the sweet tamarind sauce from kobab korner and make it taste better  Green sauce - is creamy, has cilantro in the taste with the heat of peppers in the front that’s really good! The consistency is a lil thicker than water and holds more spices than some others. I like the flavor profile of the sauce a lot! Way better than kobab korner!",['Restaurants'],113076969571004526901,1383337526,"Nov 1, 2013",102169869959618294100

5.0,Touleng Vang,"One of the best places for pho.  The restaurant and the shopping center are nothing to look at, but it's all about the food.  The menu is pretty standard for a pho shop (pho, rice dishes, and vermicelli bowls).  The staff is nice and friendly.  Service is quick; perhaps too quick...as soon as I sat down, I was asked if I was ready to order.  But no biggie, I just asked for more time...this is typical of Vietnamese restaurants cause custmers usually know what the want.  They only offer 3 appetizers (spring roll, veggie spring roll, and egg roll), but they are very good, nonetheless.  The spring roll consists of halved boiled shrimp, sliced Vietnamese pork roll, vermicelli noodles and lettuce...it's pretty standard fare but rolled up nice and tight with peanut sauce on the side.  The egg roll is tiny but has a lot of flavor...my guess is that it's of the frozen variety, but a quality brand (I think I actually have the same ones at home)...the egg roll is rolled to nicely to be homemade.  Regardless, it was good and the dipping sauce was perfect.  For pho, it's all about the broth (a line borrowed from another author, but very true).  And Pho 21 does it right.  I don't think it's better than Pho Danh (in the Hong Kong mall) or Bodard Bistro, but it's certainly right up there and good enough for a return visit.  The only condiments they offered at the table are oyster sauce and saracha, but I'm sure they'll have everything else in the kitchen.  I look forward to trying their beef stew and vermicelli dishes.  My only gripe is that I wish they offered grilled pork/beef spring rolls...it's difficult to find a place that offers this AND a great bowl of pho.  It's often one or the other.",['Restaurant'],110955030191040322864,1327606159,"Jan 26, 2012",102187165175482609052
5.0,Touleng Vang,"The brisket is as good as any other fine bbq joint.  The bbq sauce is a nice compliment to all the meats...it has a gravy consistency and the flavor isn't too over-powering.  The pork roast is very tender.  Skip the beef short ribs; they were disappointing...either over-cooked or yesterday's special (dry and hard).  The stuffed baked potato is a must-try and a meal in itself.  They offer two versions; traditional and bbq.  I ordered the traditional cause I already had a plate of bbq.  My only complaint is that I would've preferred the dish being tossed in the oven for a minute or so to melt the cheese and heat the bacon bits, as they were both served cold...the heat from the potato was only good enough to melt the chuncks of butter beneath the pile of toppings...but this is my own preference and many of you would care less.  The jambalaya was very good...no complaints of overseasoning here.  The fries were nice and crispy.  I'll have to make time on a weekend and try their ox-tail dish.  Overall, this is a great place for bbq and fried seafood.

Upon arrival, not only had they forgotten the crushed peppers but i was CHARGED $3.00 for the ""extra pepperoni""!!!! When I called be to inquire the lady on the phone (whom I had given the order to) responded by saying ""why would we put the extra pepperoni on the pizza if you didn't want to be charged?"" It just seemed so condescending and ignorant. Had I knew that I would have just ordered it all pepperoni and peeled off the peps myself!

It was disgusting, inexcusable, and needless to say ruined our meal.  On our last visit, Monday around 7:30, only two tables were seated and that didn't seem right.  We were soon to learn why.  The menu in the restaurant has been increased again, which is higher by 5-20% than the menu posted on the web site, and the previous complimentary house salad was now an additional $5.95.  Wow, that's an increase of 5-40% depending upon what you order.  Also the wine menu has been up-scaled, prices increased significantly, and there are no longer moderately priced wines available.  For our appetizer we split an order of Calamari Fritti which was now fresh but at 11.95 was 20% higher than the menu on the web site, and slightly overcooked.  My partner ordered Scallopini Piccata, at 5% more than the menu on the web site, which arrived slathered in mushrooms which are not supposed to be on the dish, and one thin overcooked slice of veal about 3"" in diameter, perhaps 2 oz.. What there was of the veal, was tough and flavorless.  I ordered Cozze (Steamed Mussels), at 15% more than the menu on the website, with white wine sauce and warning to not overcook, as I had previously experienced.  I received Cozze ""Marinara"" (sort of), not what I ordered,  and the mussels were grossly overcooked and dried out. I sent them back and with some trepidation ordered the Snapper Siciliano, at 12% more than the menu on the web site.  This was served with an excessive amount of ingredients concealing one medium shrimp and two scraps of different fish, neither of which was snapper.  That was sent that back also.  I talked with the manager who was apologetic and offered still another selection, but after two attempts and the sorry Scallopini Piccata, we were through.  On the only bright side the bread was excellent, french bread, drizzled garlic butter,  and dusted with course ground Parmesan cheese.  The waiter and his helper were truly excellent, as was the pianist. Enough to bring us back?  No, I don't think so.","['Italian Restaurant', 'European Restaurant']",116831549606325256163,1373975357,"Jul 16, 2013",102295942145853119869

These are the kind of ribs where you have nothing left but the bone when you are done. The staff was very friendly.

Often hiring inexperienced workers, they throw much responsibility (and blame) unto them within their first over-scheduled week. I had a friend who was employed there for a short amount of time and she would come home in tears every night. The manager named Cisco, the one that looks like Carlos Mencia, is horrid and down talks to his employees regularly. I've only had the fortune of eating here on one occasion,  and while the food was surprisingly delicious and well presented, it was overshadowed by the repulsive staff. The manager on duty (mencia/Cisco) and a few employees were standing in very close proximity to us, vilely mocking the behavior of my party while loudly bad-mouthing us. This cafe is so unprofessional that it's tragic. I haven't been back since and wouldn't recommenced you go either unless you like supporting sexist and demeaning establishments.

1.0,Alicia Adams,"I wish is was possible not to give them any stars because this establish doesn't even deserve one. I went in to get a small (which is 10) spicy garlic wings to go. Be mindful that the restaurant wasn't busy at this time. The first ten minutes pass and a guy who was there before me receives his order and realizes they've only given him half of it. Another guy walks in to pick up an order he called it, and it still isn't ready for him. The second ten minutes pass and a lot more people start coming through to dine-in. A worker comes in and starts randomly asking people where they want to sit not even bothering to take them in the order that they arrived. So thirty minutes have passed and I'm still waiting on my 10 wings. (And the guy who was before me is still waiting on the second half of his order). They finally bring the man who called in his order his food. They bring the man before me the other half of his food. Then, the lady proceeds to tell me that somebody took my food so they had to remake my wings. She doesn't wait for my response and disappears. I stand at the counter because by this point I've been waiting for TEN wings for FORTY-FIVE minutes and I just want my money back.  No one shows up for about another 5 minutes and when they do, of course they have my food without my ranch dressing. At this point I just wanted to get out of there so I took my food in left. I was entirely disappointed that I waited that long for some wings that weren't even good. I love BWW, but I will NEVER come to this one again.

5.0,Jonathan L.,"Be ready to wait in line on a Sunday for brunch! Most locals stop by after Sunday service. The waiting time itself isn't too bad, especially when you're going with a group. (We waited a little over half an hour.)  Service is quick and the food of course is the epitome of Southern comfort food. The popular items are the katfish and grits (they'll get angry if you spell it with a ""c"") and wings and waffles. Prices are very reasonable with a range of 10-13 dollars. In addition, you'll probably won't be spending any more money on food since you'll be stuffed for the rest of the day.  So, is there a proper way of eating the wings and waffles? Yes! First drizzle the dish with honey. Then take a big bite of that tasty wing/drumstick and quickly stuff your mouth with a slice of that honey-drenched waffle. A must-visit if you are in H-town.","['Breakfast Restaurant', 'Soul Food Restaurant']",115968992644606085412,1380503007,"Sep 29, 2013",102632395014765406760

Food - The food was bad...and the wait time was ridiculous for a burger.  Don't waste your time on this venue when you can go to any fast food place and get a better product and cheaper for what you are getting.    Service - The staff was very rude and just didn't seem like they wanted to be there.  The food and service was so bad, I requested to speak with the manager and was told by the staff that he wouldn't be in until 7:30 pm that evening.  Well, with me being very upset, I waited since it was very close to being that time.  I finally left close to 9 pm and he still didn't show up.  I've called back to speak with him on the phone, left a message and phone number, no call back.  So, basically, this symbolizes that there is absolutely no leadership, professionalism, and/or give a damn about customer service with this venue at all.

I had all of the usual dishes - chicken khema, chicken tikka masala, naan, cilantro chicken, etc.  What I'll say is that the meat tasted good, well-cooked, and as expected. The sauces and spices - the star of all the dishes - were on point.  They weren't overpowering even though there were liberal amounts of spice and sauce in relative dishes. They were fresh, tasty, and authentic.  To be a bit honest, I didn't expect this level of quality at a buffet.    In short, Cuisine India has delicious, authentic Indian food.

5.0,Sean Brown,"NABI was a great Korean-American fusion experience. The interior has high ceilings and seems spacious, while at the same time avoiding the pretension plaguing many other Asian fusion restaurants.    The food was excellent, especially the dumpling dishes - I would especially recommend the duck dumplings. The ramen was also excellent and the base was somewhat reminiscent of miso (fermented soy). I wish the food were spicier, but can understand toning the Korean spices down somewhat for the sake of fusion. For example, the chile edamame is a great appetizer, but I wish it was a bit spicier.   While there are some nits to pick for my personal taste, all the things I've sampled here are great, and the dishes are very creative while not straying too far away from ""Asian.""

We also ordered kadai chicken which was basically a bowl with less gravy and 4 large chunks of chicken that was either boiled separately ( with no spices) and just mixed with some quickly prepared masala gravy. The overall quality of the food was so poor that we threw the 4 chunks of chicken pieces in the trash and used the gravy to eat the 2 nans. I didnt bother telling him as it was no use. When I went to pay with credit card he asked for cash with no reason given. He charged me $25 ( tandoori chicken + kadai chicken + 2 naan) with no receipt. I didnt want to argue and just took cash and paid him.  Not going there ever. He has two mexican cooks helping him and that may be the reason for the poor quality of food.

I asked for creamers with my coffee.. they got tossed on the table from about a foot away.. not because the waiter was mad but because he had his head turned and was chatting with the other 5 people on staff that were all just standing around doing absolutely NOTHING.  I ordered a waffle and eggs.  Waffle was cold.. brought to the table, dry,  with NO BUTTER.  By the time the poorly trained server finally got back to the table with two small fake butter cups, the waffle was so cold it never melted the butter.  The syrup was pulled directly from the refrigerator... cold again.  I never got a glass of water to go with my coffee.. isn't this just standard?  Then, you ask and still don't receive it...  Our group of 3 received our food orders at different times.  The other two people at my table had their food and were eating when the waiter finally brought my order to the table.  He stood there, looking at our table and asked: ""who had the waffle?"" REALLY ???????   You MORON.. how about the ONLY person at the table with no food ?????  There were many servers standing around doing nothing, there were very few customers there - more employees than customers... and service was horrible. The staff was laughing, talking loudly, a few screams and laughter broke out behind the counter and just a bunch of general horseplay. This is all lack of training and supervision by management.

3.0,James Beswick,"A good selection of appetizers and exciting-looking entrees with peppy service presented in a vibrant and just-loud-enough dining area. It's an eclectic fusion menu where everything I tried was well prepared and despite the smaller portions was tasty enough to want to keep trying more. Unfortunately the bar area is a whole other story and almost the opposite experience, trading a faux nightclub environment for any attempt at service whatsoever. An army of attractive-looking servers does their best to ignore customers and fail at even the most basic service prerequisites. Skip the bar and head to the restaurant.","['Singaporean Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Southeast Asian Restaurant']",116278443587676915828,1392122993,"Feb 11, 2014",102951244563603960635
4.0,James Beswick,"A much-needed revamp of the chain's decor leaves this famous Houston hangout looking like a nightclub but the increasingly busy Happy Hour features a good set of well thought out appetizers at very reasonable prices. The tuna tacos and crab sliders are worth the trip alone. Reasonable pricing ends at Happy Hour and in the main dining room the expense account crowd indulges in $50 steaks that's aren't as good as Ruth's Chris or Del Frisco's. Morton's has killed the 3-minute steak presentation that used to be a hallmark and after years of wishing it was stopped, I actually now kind of miss it.","['Steak House', 'Seafood Restaurant']",117400897280698948068,1387377087,"Dec 18, 2013",102951244563603960635
3.0,Jim Wilson,"Saw glowing reviews so I had to try it.  First, the lights in the main room shine through the fans so they flash on the table. The tea is weak and the (real) glass is too small for me. The chips are thin (which I like) but the red sauce is heated (I like cold) and the verde had a lot of lime. Ordered a small chile con queso for the chips but it comes with its own portion of thick and dark fried flour tortilla chips (which I didn't want or need).  Ordered 1 crispy beef taco, 1 taco al carbon and 1 tamal (tamale), replacing the refried beans with charro beans. Receiving the large plate, presentation was decent however they forgot and put refried beans on the plate so I tried them but I detected a smoky-metallic taste I really didn't like. The charra beans were just bland. The beef taco was overflowing and actually pretty good as was the taco al carbon that had a good flavor. The tamal was not the smaller Tex-Mex type but the larger thicker version and not what I prefer though it was pretty tasty on its own.  Overall, Fiesta Charra is not terrible but was not a big hit for me and won't be my regular destination for Mexican food.","['Mexican Restaurant', 'Latin American Restaurant']",102644007786205106962,1361071121,"Feb 16, 2013",102954505126528013131

Fortunately I was really hungry because with their very modest prices, I wasn't sure if my co-worker and I would be able to order $20 worth (that was the voucher value) of food and be able to finish it all.  We ordered 20 wings (lemon pepper and garlic parmesan), a 6"" philly cheesesteak sandwich with chips, and a couple cans of soda which barely crossed the $20 threshold.  The place is very modest-looking and is obviously structured primarily for carry-out and delivery service as there are only a couple of very small tables inside.  The guy who took our order (seemed like he may have been the manager) was very pleasant.  Wings at pizza joints are usually hit or miss, but these turned out surprisingly good, obviously deep fried rather than oven-baked.

We asked for just quail for an appetizer and was informed that it was already prepared and could not accommodate. Our ordered consisted of a New York strip well done, red snapper, broccoli,  potatoes au gratin, and fries. The steak and broccoli was perfect however the fish was dry, the potatoes was like cheese soup and the fries had truffle oil on them. They replaced the potatoes with mashed potatoes and they were the best. The fish came back very dry and burnt. I was finish with my steak and potatoes by the time my wife receive the fish. When the fish came out the third time it was okay to eat but looked rushed.  I would return but i would talk to the manager prior to being seated. We spent 2 1/2 hours at the resturant. I am not sure if the staff was slow because of mothers day but I will give them another chance because of some potion of the food. They have one chance to redeem themselves or I will never go back.

5.0,Deja Land,"""I came here for my 2 year anniversary, and after reviewing the menu I decided there was nothing that I would even consider trying.. However...  My boyfriend convinced me into staying for at least one dish, considering the amazing reviews. We opted for the Meatball dish with Fish Sauce.. I let Nabeel take the first bite and his face really concerned me as he immediately lost all expression... when he finally spoke his exact words were ""This is the best food I have ever had in my Entire Life.""   I gave in and tried the Meatball with Fish Sauce.. and immediately I realized that everything I had eaten up to this point in my life had been a waste of time and taste buds. The food is like nothing Houston has ever offered - and to be honest, unlike anything I thought was even imaginable. At that moment I understood a Chef's passion.. to make their clients experience this!  We requested the waiter to make two more selections which included Goat and a Lamb Macaroni. I could not have been happier with the evening and I have recommended Underbelly to everyone I come across.  I am still craving the food and cannot wait for our return.

She said the spice covering the chicken shrimp was gritty and tasteless, but stole away any chance of tasting the chicken and shrimp.  I had the riblet basket which had a decent flavor sauce, but you had to fight the bone slivers. The rib meat was hidden by the sauce.   I would have preferred a the bone to hold on to. The kids had chicken tenders and corndog.  These were the smallest chicken tenders I have ever seen.  The best part of the entire meal had to be the french fries.

It sounded like they put me on hold, but they didn't say something like ""hey were going to put you on hold for a sec"". After waiting a bit I just hung up, and would find out the total when I pick up. I get there and there all confused and asked if I was the person waiting for a total. They said they didn't start the order yet. I said that's fine, I'll wait since its a quick appetizer. Then the lady walked away. After that, a waiter comes up to me and says "" hello sir what would you like to order"". I couldn't believe I had to start all over again from square one, I just said screw it and left.

I tried to get information about the menu but instead of helping she hung up the phone.   I figured they must be busy so I decided to stop by.  I looked at the menu and decided on chicken and ribs. The lady at the front taking the orders said they were out of chicken and beef. But they had ""ribs"". I asked how many pounds per the price.  She said she didn't know and there wasn't anyone who could help.  I asked her why was she at the front taking orders if she didn't know the menu or any options. No one else was available to help and I left without ordering.  After such poor customer service I will never return to this establishment.

The location and innovation of this store pulled me right in, checking out what it had to offer! What a gentle, patient, and easy going staff they have! Then the food/smoothie/juice selection couldn't be any more thought out! From vegan spaghetti plates, to raw kale salad, to a strawberry, banana, soy milk or apple juice smoothie. Also the add-in ingredients for the smoothies range from flax oil, spirulina, and bee pollen thus allowing customers to customize and create what they want! Then the supplements and other amenities they offer on their shelves is a beautiful sites. Booklets about the spice of the ginger, and other herbs. Sunshine Food Mart a wonderful collaboration of items for all sorts of needs! Natural shampoos, soaps, lotions, toothpaste...you'll be blown away! So once you order your food you can take a look around then make your way to a table in the location that best suites you, and they will call out your order when ready. A laid back place, with cheap prices, specials, friendly service, and inspiration that will have to make you come back for a second and third time and beyond. Meet here for a juice, lunch, dinner date, or just to run in and out grabbing the item you just ran out of! I recommend this place to everyone.

3.0,David Monroe,"Slightly on the expensive side.  Five Guys and Mooyah have just as good of burgers if not better for cheaper, but this place has a ""real restaurant"" atmosphere where those other two feel more fast food.  My only complaint about eating at this (or other Fudruckers) is my fellow patrons.  For instance I just left a few minutes ago, there were two women looking at the soda dispenser like it was alien technology and they just stood in front of the thing and stared.  Finally after a few minutes they got out of the way, sans soda.  When they paged me to get my burger the same two women were staring at the condiment dispensers the same way.  (Sadly this part of the review was written before they put in the newer touch-screen soda dispensers)  I don't mean to pick on these two women, this happens every time I'm there.  There is always someone who seems to not have the slightest idea how to work a salad bar or a pump dispenser and they're always just ahead of you, every time you turn around.  At least the staff is great and I don't think they've ever messed up my order, which is better than I can say about most places.  It would also be nice if they had a bike rack for me to park at, as it stands I chain my bike to a pole in the middle of their bushes.  I had to knock a star off because the ""red spice"" - I'm not sure what it is - that every single other Fuddruckers I've been to has is not available at this location and hasn't been in years.  If you ask for it someone might hunt down a shaker - they blame it on theft, usually walk around the place, look at every table and the fixin's bar where it should be, but it's never there, it wasn't there when they opened that day, I don't know why they look.","['American Restaurant', 'Takeout Restaurant', 'Hamburger Restaurant']",101845749636118370051,1375614706,"Aug 4, 2013",104092473020837030850

My family and I love B Dubs and any time we have poor food or poor service it is a huge let down! My son and I went to watch some more football after the Texan's game against the Broncos. The Texan's loss had nothing to do with this rating by the way. We arrived around 3:45 pm, we were greeted and seated promptly, our server came by our table in a timely manner taking our drink order and an appetizer order for fried pickles. Drinks were delivered correctly, fried pickles were just O.K.. Then came the wait from hell!! An hour later we were told the kitchen was ""traying  our order"", and it would be out in a minute. One of the Shift Leaders walked by and made the mistake of asking if everything was O.K.? Advised the Shift Leader of how long we had been waiting and that we could use some drink refills. The Shift Leader apologized and then made excuses as to why it was taking so long. There were only about 8 tables in the dinning area customers with the biggest table of 7 people. I also noted the bar area was at bout 45% capacity. The Shift Leader reported that his kitchen crew was hit by many of the orders at the same time, and he knew he should not be making excuses.

There was no point in complaining due to the fact that she is the owner's daughter/family.

It was fun, good sushi, delicious cocktails, and I think everyone enjoyed themselves.  THANK YOU FOR YOUR AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS ON MY BIRTHDAY MS. SUPER HOSTESS!

They have a really fancy touchscreen soda dispenser with a lot of different sodas you can try - gimmicky, but it's neat.   The food is nothing special, but if you work nearby it's a decent place to chill out on your lunch hour. The chances of seeing anyone you know are pretty low, as most of their clientele seems to come from traffic to the nearby retail stores. There's a Kroger nextdoor if you need to do some quick shopping. The service people are decent, one of them even knows my name. Sometimes the burritos are wrapped loosely such that they fall apart when you eat them.   It's not bad, but it's not that good either. Gets the job done.

The one decent micro beer they have was empty kegged. No decent alternatives in bottles either. Waitress did not even know what beer they had without having to make return trip. Oh, and despite the place being hardly even occupied, it look about 15 minutes to get 4 beers delivered to our table. Strike one.  Ordered nachos, and some chips and queso for our group to snack on. When the chips came, the chips were cold, the salsa was completely tasteless and not at all spicy (this is Texas right?). Worst of all, the cheese was - unbelievably - watered down at least 50%. It was disgusting, and although a bit hungry it was barely eatable. The Nacho plate had melted cheese and was a bit better, but also very light on toppings, small.  Strike two.  When I mentioned the gross cheese to the waitress, she shrugged her shoulders and acted like she didn't care what the food was like. Although not a big cost bill here, the experience was bad.

I don't often get to eat rich food as this but bookmarked Mikki's as my go to place whenever I get the taste for it.  I haven't been on months but found myself frequenting Mikki's twice in two weeks time.  I'm not sure what happened between the time that I first came here and these last couple of times, but it's all gone down hill.  I had the smothered steak the last time that I had I was there but found the portion that I was given left something to be desired.  I thought that everybody must have a bad day and gave them another chance today. This time I was fully disappointed and disgusted by my experience.  I ordered the brisket and was given two small dried pieces over rice.  No juices or gravy was put over the rice, so it was dried meat on dried rice(which had been scraped from the bottom of the pan).  The people serving me acted as if I was imposing on their time by frequenting the restaurant.  The side items were pilled high, but tasted very off today.  And cornbread was shoved into my bag, without anybody asking which one I preferred.  The cashier just took my card, swiped it, and shoved it back to me with a pen.  And not even a thank you from any of the staff along the way or as I was leaving.  I only ate half the food and tossed the rest away, as it was unbearable to even brave through. I highly doubt that I will be coming back here again, as it seems that the quality, quantity, and customer service that impressed me on my first visit has obviously went to the dogs along with the food.","['Restaurant', 'Soul Food Restaurant']",114652251513183778111,1376278176,"Aug 11, 2013",104438125649874089913

That because this place is still pretty awesome and here's why.  It's a community thing. The same folks go at the same time most mornings and see each other, say 'hay gurl' and have a good old time.

Since January 2012 this place has gone downhill on service, as if possible.  Every time I have been in there this year the second I finished eating I have been rushed out of the restaurant and been given dirty looks by management if my party does not leave right away.  This used to be the kind of place you could sit and enjoy a few mimosas and conversation after brunch, but no more.  On top of this they now have valet parking which makes the parking (trying to leave is the worst) a total nightmare.  I never had problems parking before and now you really have no other option but to valet.  The food is fantastic and the mimosas to die for but the opportunity cost of what I am giving up to deal with rude, neglectful servers and rude management is not worth it anymore.

Therefore, we decided to go back again for a Sat dinner.  Visited 8/31/13.  Had the Super pizza, side salad, fried onion sticks & peppers.  The food was good and service was great; however, one hour later I thought I was going to die.  I had body aches, chills, fever, violent vomiting & diarrhea for 3 days.  This was the only food that I had eaten all day except for crackers earlier in the day.  No one else in my group became ill but me; however, I was the only one that had a salad.

The prices are the same as Del Frisco's Double Eagle Steakhouse in downtown New York (which was worth every penny).  Even the Del Frisco's by The Galleria doesn't taste like prime beef.  Everything else was priced about right, but go ahead and order wine by the bottle, it is overpriced by the glass.  Only food issue was the Creme Broule. Tasted really pre packaged...Sysco style.

Then I ask my boyfriend how his is and he says it tasted disgusting. I tasted it and it had no flavor at all you couldnt even tell it was crab meat there was no kind of bacon in it. It looked as well like a plate of throw up. We both were not even able to take more than 3 bites. Very upset I paid anything for these meals when I could have made better at my house.

5.0,Yaseen Haq,"**READ FOR WARNING** I have been going to Oiishi's for several years now and it has always been the best Sushi restaurant I've been to. They have pretty reasonably priced food and their wait staff is amazing. They are all really nice and positive and have always been like that. Things to consider: 1. Parking is tight. There are a few spots in front of the restaurant and a small lot beside the restaurant that has it's own driveway. 2. It's usually packed so plan ahead and come early. They open at 11am. By 12 there is hardly any place to park, let alone sit in the restaurant without a delay. 3. If you have a shellfish allergy be careful. I developed one two years ago and it of course seriously limited what I could eat there. I have had the Chicken Tempura Rolls regularly for the past year and a half and it has always been amazing.  **However, yesterday after I ate the Chicken Tempura Rolls I immediately went into anaphylactic shock. I guess they fried the chicken in the same oil as shrimp.**  So... As much as I love Oishii's I probably will never go back. The risk is too great at this point. If you don't have anything like this to worry about then I promise you, you'll love this place and come back for more.","['Japanese Restaurant', 'Asian Restaurant', 'Sushi Restaurant']",115503936740558608714,1334061011,"Apr 10, 2012",105052065349542347283

4.0,Ryan Hammond,"We went to Niko Niko on our visit to Houston last week.  Everything I saw said that this was the place to experience the best in Greek cuisine and for the most part it lived up to the hype.  Location is near Rice University, in a quaint neighborhood that offers much to explore.  I would love a week to try all of the restaurants near by.  Niko Niko is an experience in itself.  It's not a place you're going to come, eat, and be out in 30 minutes.  First off, parking is a nightmare.  It's a small plot of land, and lots of people, like you, want to try this place.  Have patience and bring love, because you'll need both to keep a smile on your face as you find a place to park the vehicle.    The restaurant is all self-service, so you're going to order at the counter.  Anticipate a 15 minute wait, but it's perfect timing while you go over the extensive menu.  The biggest downside is that the self-serve drink station is immediately to the right of the order line.  This requires lots of jockying as you have guests leaving the restaurant to your left, and others trying to fill their drinks to your right.  Traffic flow has no other option in this small space.  Their doing the best that they can without building a new place.    The line moves quickly in peak hours.  Those taking your order are friendly and understand that this process is not the best experience of your day, but the food will surely win you over.  After taking your order, you will receive a pager and now it's time to find a seat.  Keep in mind that there is additional seating all the way in the back in the ""patio room"".  Food came out in about 10 minutes.  I don't know how they keep track of all the food at the window, but they have it mastered.  It was like Air Traffic Control at LaGuardia Airport.    Food was delicious.  I ordered a Gyro sandwhich and there was more meat in it than I've ever seen in a Gyro.  Bravo for not being cheap with the meat.  We also ordered a side of Dolmaths, and Cabbage Rolls.  I couldn't believe how ""on-spot"" the cabbage rolls were.  They tasted just like my Chech grandmother used to make.  For just over $1/ea, you've got to sample these.    This place is popular for a reason - great food.  You won't regret taking the time to visit, but be sure to bring your credit card - it's not cheap.  For two adults and two 10-year old boys, our final total came to over $55 (and we didn't have left overs).  At this price, we could have eaten anywhere in town for lunch and not fought with the crowds, or had to serve ourselves.  That takes nothing away from the food, I just don't think we'll be back for a while.","['Greek Restaurant', 'Mediterranean Restaurant', 'Cafe']",100049916095060220864,1388771793,"Jan 3, 2014",105096501746767034170

I am not a hushpuppy person, but they made me fall in love with the lightly crispy outside and moist, sweet inside. The corn is a perfect touch.  Now, don't get me started on the fish. I have NEVER tasted such good fish. I wholeheartedly recommend this place. It is a perfect sample of southern food! I can't wait for my next visit!",['Seafood Restaurant'],103541918179886408890,1368483702,"May 13, 2013",105414690481677500660

2.0,Talena Butters,Management and staff are rude and not trained well.

5.0,Bridget Parker,"I go several times a month for gyros. The gyros are always packed full, fresh, hot and the best I've ever had and Alwadi's prices are GREAT, also. Very friendly people. The French fries that come with the combo are awesome also and so is the garlic sauce. Here is a tip: Call in advance and place your order! That way, you will never have to wait.","['Mediterranean Restaurant', 'Sandwich Shop']",103061257363012215363,1386272992,"Dec 5, 2013",105435984883869690364
5.0,Stephen Matthews,Home Base Pizza is the BEST pizza shop we've found in the Cypress area. Much better than all the chain stores and they are by far the most generous in topping proportions I've seen! Great tasting pizza with great fresh toppings and plenty of them! That's what I want in a pizza and that is what I have found at Home Base Pizza. 5 Stars and 2 thumbs up!,['Pizza Restaurant'],115499630951377278380,1385860090,"Nov 30, 2013",105437278877095935368
5.0,Bob Buentello,"By far the best Quiznos location. I've been to other locations, and the service was just unsatisfactory. When I stumbled upon this location, ny opinion about this chain changed. The service at this location was excellent. The restaurant is neat and clean. And the staff is top notch. Though it's a fairly long drive for me, I will definitely return to this Quiznos.","['Sandwich Shop', 'Fast Food Restaurant', 'Food Delivery']",116779945879230061290,1383705460,"Nov 5, 2013",105442114965246835171
